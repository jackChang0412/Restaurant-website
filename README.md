1. Background

To improve our brand image, attract foreign customers, and meet the operational requirements of our future international locations, we must develop a website to expand our business to other countries. To guarantee that consumers worldwide can readily obtain restaurant information, the website will be primarily in English and tailored for people from other countries. The goal of the website is to provide an online brand image and features of the restaurant and increase the conversion rate of overseas customers.

2. Goal

  1. Support for International Market Expansion: Customers can easily know the restaurant's information in English.
  2. High-quality brand image: Emphasize the restaurant's features and values to attract international customers.
  3. Enhance the user experience: Ensure the website is easy to use so customers can quickly find important information (menu, address, reservation).
